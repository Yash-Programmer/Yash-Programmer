### 🔥 About Me
I started coding when I was just 9 years old — mostly for fun and out of curiosity. What began as a playful interest quickly turned into a passion for building, experimenting, and solving problems. I used to automate boring tasks and make my everyday digital life easier. Some of my earliest projects (you might still find them in my repos) include a YouTube video downloader, a GUI-based calculator, a number-to-name converter, and a percentage finder. Those projects laid the foundation for what I'm doing today — pushing boundaries with tech and turning ideas into impact.

### 🚀 Some Cool Stuff I’ve Built


- 🏋️ **FitPlan** – A smart fitness and wellness planner that generates customized workout and diet routines based on your goals and lifestyle. Your virtual fitness buddy, built with tech and tailored for you.
- 🎭 **Auditorium Booking App** – A sleek web app built for my school to simplify the process of booking the auditorium for events and rehearsals. Clean, quick, and reliable.
- 🔐 **Maya – Women Safety System** – A complete safety-tech project that integrates policy, community, and smart defense tech on a website.
- 🍿 **Netflix Clone** – A stunning front-end clone of Netflix with smooth UI, responsive design, and dynamic content previews. Built to bring that binge-worthy experience into my own codebase.
- 🧾 **Quote System** – A quote aggregator that curates powerful thoughts and words from great minds across history. Clean interface, daily inspiration, and timeless wisdom — all in one place.
- 🇮🇳 **Independence Struggle Website** – A tribute site that chronicles India’s journey to freedom — highlighting unsung heroes, powerful movements, and stories that shaped our nation. Made with passion, backed by research, and driven by pride.

These aren’t just passion projects — they’re little revolutions I’ve built, pixel by pixel 💥
